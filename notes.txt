  sending:
    +n+1
      they are ahead, ask to receive.
      this might happen on initial connections, if they think you might be further ahead.
      they have asked us to send, but they'll probably change their mind. +send +receive
    +n
      we are in sync, and neither knows who is closer to the source.
      since the actual receiver does not. +send
    +n-1
      they are behind us, get the next item for them. +send !get

    -(n+1)
      they are ahead of us, stop sending.
      ask to receive from them (but they don't want anything from us) -send +receive
    -n
      stop sending, we know they are in sync, so no need to send notes. -send
    -(n-1)
      stop sending, but send notes sometimes. -send

  receiving:
    +n+1
      they ask to receive from us, but we are not up to there.
      *enable send* I guess, but don't expect to send. +send
    +n
      they ask to receive from us, but we are already in sync.
      send a note to let the know we are in sync, if we havn't already.
    +(n-1)
      they ask to receive, but are behind us. +send

    -(n+1)
      expect them still to send to us, though. -send
    -(n)
      they just let us know we are in sync
    -(n-1)
      they are behind us, but are still getting messages faster than they would from us.
      get ready to send a note about where we are up to.

  if the absolute value is greater, and we are not already receiving, ask to receive.
  else if positive, turn on send (and get ready if we have something)
  else if negative, turn off send.

UPDATE

all negative notes are shifted -1. to say you have sequence 1
but do not want more on that feed, send -2. -1 now means
"I do not have and do not want this feed"

requesting 0 means "I don't have anything from this feed, please send it"
and a -ve number means "I have this but stop sending, because I have a better source"
you can't send -0 because if you have a better source for nothing
that means you don't want it. which is what -1 means.
if you have seq 1, and someone else trys to give it to you,

TAKE 2. a lot of what we need to run a real ebt network ended up in ssb-ebt, and it should
be in this repo so it's easy to extend this to other protocols.

clock: {id: seq,...},
connections: {
  peer_id: {
    clock: {id: +/- seq,...},
    msgs: [], //messages that can be sent.
    notes: {id: +/- seq, ...}, //notes to send. gets replaced with {} after sending.
    next: [id,...],
    replicating: {
      id: {tx: bool, rx: bool, retrive: bool, sent: seq},...
    }
  }
},

if this was all binary...

clock: HashTable(id:seq), //10k*4 = 40k
connections: {
  hashtable(peer_id: { //4*25 = 100
    clock: HashTable(id:+/-seq), //(25~10k)*40 100~40k
    msgs: CircularBuffer(8k*10), //80k
    replicating: HashTable(id: [sent, Pointer(next), Flags(tx,rx,retrive)]), //4+4+1
    next: Pointer(next), last: Pointer(last) //pointers into the hashtable //4+4
  })
}

40k + N*(80k + M(10*4+9+4 = 53))
